# Hi, I'm Anie! 👋 (she/them) 🏳️‍⚧️

I enjoy embedded systems development and analog electronics. I especially enjoy the challenge of optimizing resource usage to the lowest possible while remaining as legible as possible.

I'm a big fan of FOSS and daily drive Fedora and GrapheneOS.

I'm also a big VR enthusiast and have been convinced of the potential spatial computing since getting my hands on an Oculus Quest 1.
I had fun getting wireless PCVR working on Nobara, a fedora based distro 🐧, a few weeks ago when I got bored 😄.
Also top 150FR on scoresaber ⚔️.
